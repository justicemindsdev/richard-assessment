        <h1>WHITE FERRY STAFF MISCONDUCT: <br>INSISTENT PAY PRESSURE, SURVEILLANCE, SELECTIVE TARGETING, AND REPORTING VULNERABLE ADULTS</h1>
        
        <p>This portal serves as a comprehensive documentation of the severe misconduct and systemic failures at PubLove White Ferry House. It highlights instances of staff negligence, targeted harassment, and the alarming disregard for vulnerable guests, despite proactive efforts by concerned individuals like Ben Mak.</p>

        <h2>KEY INCIDENT: THE URINE MAN AT THE DOOR</h2>
        <div class="section-box">
            <p>One of the most egregious examples of the unsafe and unsanitary environment at White Ferry House is the incident involving a man urinating directly at a guest's door. This event, coupled with the subsequent lack of appropriate response from staff and management, underscores a profound failure in duty of care and basic hospitality standards.</p>

            <div class="evidence-item">
                <div class="timestamp">9th May 2025</div>
                <div class="description"><strong>Visual Evidence:</strong> A guest captured photographic and video evidence of a man urinating at the door.</div>
                <div class="note">This incident is a direct indicator of compromised hygiene and security, creating an intolerable living condition for guests.</div>
            </div>
            <p>This incident is not isolated but symptomatic of a broader pattern of neglect and mismanagement, where staff are seemingly under pressure to ignore critical issues, leading to a hostile environment for both guests and ethical employees.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>SYSTEMIC ISSUES AT WHITE FERRY</h2>
        <div class="section-box">
            <h3>Insistent Pay Pressure & Surveillance:</h3>
            <p>Reports indicate that staff at White Ferry are subjected to insistent pay pressure, which may contribute to a culture where critical issues are overlooked or deliberately ignored to cut costs. This is compounded by an environment of surveillance, where staff actions are monitored, potentially leading to selective targeting of individuals who attempt to uphold ethical standards or report misconduct.</p>

            <h3>Selective Targeting and Reporting of Vulnerable Adults:</h3>
            <p>There is evidence suggesting a disturbing pattern of selective targeting and inappropriate reporting of vulnerable adults. Instead of addressing the root causes of issues, the focus appears to shift to blaming or misrepresenting the actions of those who are either vulnerable or who attempt to intervene responsibly. This creates a dangerous precedent and a hostile environment for both guests and staff who prioritize safety and ethical conduct.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>CALL TO ACTION</h3>
            <p>This documentation serves as a critical resource for legal review, regulatory bodies, and public awareness. It is imperative that these systemic failures are addressed to ensure the safety and well-being of all guests and to protect ethical staff members from unjust targeting and retaliation.</p>
