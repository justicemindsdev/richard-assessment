I’m really embarrassed I called my Mum as was feeling a bit sad as was finishing some notes on Damians information to put some guidance in place and as per 
👉🏻🫥👈🏼 
gets all the blame, ended up ending the call leaving White ferry in a rush to not end up getting upset- I can’t find my bank card and mum sisters not answering 😫 I will go bank tomorrow and get new card- I am really sorry to ask as I am stuck in limbo but if I could borrow £35 till tomorrow afternoon? I just need to eat and go to bed having to cancel the car accident I just want I early night…. So sorry to ask my mind is blank and I just feel a little bewildered at the moment #ascendsAttempt 🦭 if not totally ok I keep calling the “family” <—- is a strong word 🤦🏻‍♂️

[28/04/2025, 00:23:48] Katie The White Ferry: I don't have zoom I stalled

[28/04/2025, 00:25:02] It’s Ben Mak ix: ‎Video call, ‎21 min
[01/05/2025, 16:46:58] Katie The White Ferry: The guy you saw working this morning said he is a new member and Mignon quickly brushed that off and said he is filling in.
[01/05/2025, 16:46:59] Katie The White Ferry: It is his first day working and she possibly knows him from another job.
[01/05/2025, 16:47:02] Katie The White Ferry: Plus I did verbalise about Nikki and being stressed working with her and about Luigi saying he would have a meeting with her.
[01/05/2025, 16:47:11] Katie The White Ferry: Not impressed.
[01/05/2025, 17:27:41] Katie The White Ferry: Also the rota for the next month has been done BEFORE the meeting has occurred.
[01/05/2025, 17:39:52] Katie The White Ferry: The chef who placed the complaint against him hates him and is trying to push for him getting fired.
[01/05/2025, 22:01:27] It’s Ben Mak ix: Not surprised- and why we need to act fast- lay down proper foundations and utilise proper channels. 

At this point it seems your out numbered, factions have formed 
(biased hiring - HR connected to new management connected  new staff) current staff have made proper complaints through proper channels putting you and Damian at a dis-advantage- as now anything you say back legit or not can be most likely will be seen as arbitrary / retaliatory. 

The new management seems focused both on you and Damien.

Anything you say “Luigi” was going todo may not be held as credible as he is gone and has no remit on the workplace other than issues or concerns he left with management which again anything said about him falls privy to the same discrediting
[01/05/2025, 22:01:47] It’s Ben Mak ix: When manager goes will need to chat cant do much with her ther
[01/05/2025, 22:09:54] It’s Ben Mak ix: I am here

[02/05/2025, 01:16:50] Katie The White Ferry: Just got home. Hoping we can have the chat soon.
[02/05/2025, 01:27:42] It’s Ben Mak ix: Great yes

[04/05/2025, 04:07:21] Katie The White Ferry: Just realised, Mignon (GM) wanted to have the chat about complaints, knowing I was already distressed about something coming into work. Why would she cause possible disruption between work colleagues whilst the person in complaint is already in a vulnerable state. ‎<This message was edited>
[04/05/2025, 15:51:19] Katie The White Ferry: Hey Mignon,
I want to raise something that happened last night. Whilst working last night, Nikki informed me that she was going downstairs and grabbed her phone. I asked her to leave her phone upstairs (thinking if she was downstairs she wouldn't need it as it would be a quick job). She soon wanted to ask me privately why she couldn't take her phone downstairs and I verbalised that she uses her phone too much. I said I have been too lenient with her. When questioned when she has used her phone, I stated in previous shifts and clarified if I see her using her phone, I will have to send her home early. 
I progressively felt guilty throughout the shift as I have overlooked it in the past. 
I later spoke with her notifying I wasn't  attacking her, she just needs to focus on work  more. To which I stated she did a good job tonight. I also asked her to go home half an hour earlier as it was quiet.
Whilst I verbalised to Zac from the Crown that this is the best shift she has done, he mentioned that he thought she did very little for the hours she was working.
[04/05/2025, 15:51:45] Katie The White Ferry: This is what I am thinking of saying to Mignon.
[06/05/2025, 01:24:38] Katie The White Ferry: If you can. Please read Damian's notes.

I do need to pay. 

——

Thanks for what I need to do rather than receive help.  

Do we think maybe a person undergoing what I’m undergoing 
“Wouldn’t— not pay for the sake of not paying or for a laugh .”

Sadly— assumption, and doubt  trumped, acknowledgement and understanding                               

“What’s going on, everything ok- do you need help at all? “

I’ve had payment and account access issue struggling to communicate as mentioned and why not even seen a bed in 2 days. I am exhausted. Your shift ends. Mine doesn’t . 

You all watch me hanging I. 
Work space  . Awake for 2 days - no bed seen full access to vale, extraction of free and  money for service not accessible. 

But I will pay. 
Despite not seeing a bed- once I get help with the access issues.

I see no drop in others Accessing and extracting expert insights on work place matter as I remain in the work place… a work place that has no-one’s back…yet I do? 
Minutes my sleeping arrangements moment would take as to the hours spent protecting you all from this same systemic policy rightly so…  helps the able being she disavow 
Backs sharply raised when my stay becomes a struggle
[19/06/2025, 20:45:10] It’s Ben Mak ix: Hi Katie,  

I hope you’re ok? 

It’s really hot and stayed out the hostel. As to not make things awkward for either of us, even in my own awkward position fighting for my little one as you know and my well being recovering form my brothers funeral , all whilst trying to keep a smile on mine and everyone’s face. 

Sadly I’ve not heard back from you? 

My last message barely makes any sense, so it’s very clear there was deep distress going on there, and more saddening that the invitation as offered by you that I certainly should reach out to you if i neeeed to.

You’ve always been brilliant being one step ahead of everyone’s needs seeing anyone’s who’s chin dips down  you being the first to stilt it right back up. 

That’s why it’s A big shock to see I’ve Not heard back from you, and there seems to be an awkwardness now that  I’d rather shift and hope you want it too aswell.

There’s a big elephant in the room, and it’s you. Except you’re not big fat heavy and grey. 

You’re slim, blonde with an Australian Caucasian glow—- an albino elephant that walks on it’s back legs, has fingers, and ties back its big blonde ears disguised as hair in a pony tail.  So if your not waving your trunk into someone’s peanut bowl lets chat?  

I’m heading back to white ferry the only place I have left  so if you have called the ombudsman let’s meet on that common ground- someone where were each side of our broken hearts fit tightly, over shared grief of a sacred bond- your mum and my dad- us both face happy deep down both sad xxx 

Big loves to you - you filthy whore xxx
