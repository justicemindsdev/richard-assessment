        <h1>THE IRONY OF SERVICE:<br>BEN'S CONSIDERATION VS. COMPANY NEGLECT</h1>
        
        <p>This document highlights the stark contrast between Ben Mak's proactive efforts to ensure guest safety and uphold professional standards, and the systemic failures and negligence exhibited by PubLove White Ferry House management and certain staff members (e.g., Richard).</p>

        <h2>BEN'S PROACTIVE DOCUMENTATION OF NEGLECT</h2>
        <div class="section-box">
            <p>Despite facing challenging and unsanitary conditions, Ben consistently documented critical incidents, demonstrating a commitment to guest welfare and company standards that was seemingly absent from others.</p>

            <h3>Incidents Documented by Ben:</h3>

            <div class="evidence-item">
                <div class="timestamp">9th May 2025</div>
                <div class="description"><strong>Man Urinating on Door:</strong> Visual evidence of a guest urinating directly on the door.</div>
                <div class="note">This incident highlights a severe breach of hygiene and guest comfort, directly impacting the living environment.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="evidence-item">
                <div class="timestamp">9th May 2025, 4:30 AM</div>
                <div class="description"><strong>Vomit on the Stairs:</strong> Documentation of vomit on communal stairwells.</div>
                <div class="note">A clear health and safety hazard, indicating a failure in immediate response and cleaning protocols.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="evidence-item">

                <div class="description"><strong>Trapped on Stairs / No Sleep:</strong> Video evidence of being trapped on stairs due to a guest vomiting and urinating, leading to no sleep.</div>
                <div class="note">This directly impacts Ben's well-being and highlights the unsafe and unmanaged environment.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="evidence-item">
                <div class="timestamp">18th June 2025</div>
                <div class="description"><strong>Cockroaches in Bathroom:</strong> Photographic evidence of cockroach infestation in the bathroom.</div>
                <div class="note">Indicates a severe and ongoing pest control issue, a direct violation of consumer protection and health standards.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="evidence-item">
                <div class="timestamp">8th May 2025</div>
                <div class="description"><strong>Swearing, Screaming, and Shouting:</strong> Audio recording of disruptive behavior in the dorm bed next to Ben.</div>
                <div class="note">Demonstrates a failure to maintain a peaceful and safe environment for guests.</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>THE IRONIC CONTRAST: BEN'S EFFORTS VS. COMPANY'S PROMO</h2>
        <div class="section-box">
            <p>While Ben was meticulously documenting severe hygiene and safety breaches, the company was simultaneously producing promotional films showcasing the "best features" of White Ferry House. This stark contrast underscores the company's apparent disregard for actual guest conditions versus its public image.</p>

            <h3>Company Promotional Films (May/June 2025):</h3>
            <div class="evidence-item">
                <div class="timestamp">15th June 2025 (Promo Film)</div>
                <div class="description">Promotional films showing "best features" of White Ferry, created by staff.</div>
                <div class="note">These films present a sanitized and misleading image, directly contradicting the documented reality of the premises.</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>BEN'S CONSIDERATION TO THE COMPANY</h2>
        <div class="section-box">
            <p>Ben's actions, far from being malicious, represent a genuine concern for the company's reputation and the safety of its guests. By documenting these issues, he provided critical internal feedback that, if addressed, could have prevented further harm and legal repercussions for the company.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> His documentation provided early warnings of significant health, safety, and safeguarding risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Conduct:</strong> Ben upheld a higher ethical standard by prioritizing guest welfare over ignoring systemic problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Protecting Reputation:</strong> By attempting to resolve these issues internally through documentation, he implicitly sought to protect the company from external complaints and regulatory action.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: A FAILURE OF DUTY</h3>
            <p>The evidence clearly demonstrates that while Ben Mak was actively engaged in responsible and ethical conduct to protect guests and the company's integrity, management and certain staff members failed in their fundamental duties of care, leading to a hazardous environment and potential legal liabilities. Ben's actions were not only justified but essential in light of the severe misconduct and neglect.</p>
