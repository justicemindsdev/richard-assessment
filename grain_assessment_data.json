So justices have to look after other justices. So when I foot this forward all the judges will have to protect me because they've got to protect the system. So they have to stick together because if they don't stick together so judges can't get condemned for their judgment, it's infallible unless the process was flawed. If they didn't do a step that's in law, they can question the judgment. But if the process was followed, the judgment can't be changed. A judge's statement is final, it can't be undone unless the process was flawed. So if you, someone wasn't interviewed that should have been, you can ask for an appeal and be like, you did that, but you didn't know this. If the process is followed, it's done. That's the point. So I've, I am in that process to be one of them. That's what the judicial process is. You have different types, you have paid tribunal and so on. I, I'm, I want to do the pop up big top ones. That's where I'm headed. Impeded, but now my process is impeded because of this school playground behavior. So that judicial position gets put on hold because I am now responding to arbitrary, non communicative unfair treatment for reasons they can't disclose when let me tell you, as an ICO policy certificate holder, anything they say about, about me belongs to me because you can't talk about someone and then not get that data because it belongs to them as soon as their name's in it. So him refusing, he's refusing to give me my own data even though he said belongs to me because my name's in it, I have a right to see it under Article 6, right to, right to a fair hearing and a right to respond. So he gave me a right to respond. They've left me with it and now I'm upset and they're now making me chase someone to get an answer on something I didn't have any input on. They've made a decision. They've made a decision without informing me. If they're gonna borrow me, they need to tell me why.",

She was like, but I can't be doing this all the time. Not, sorry, Ben, that someone was weeing on the door when you wanted to go to your room.
